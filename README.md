palantir.js
===========

~~A pseudo-functional style javascript framework of pure awesomeness.~~ 

Unfortunately this project has underwent a feature creep and as much as I love it and treat it as my child, 
it is rather a child that you don't want to show to your friends, no matter how beautiful it is for you.

Because of that, consider the project as frozen - I've learned an awful lot while developing it, 
it is the time to move on now.
